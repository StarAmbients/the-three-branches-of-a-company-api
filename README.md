We intend to work locally (localhost) with MySQL, deploy the app on Atlas for using MongoDB and on Amazon WS for using PostgreSQL.

Mongo DB:

2 Create and deploy an M0 cluster
3 Add your connection IP address to your IP access list
4 Create a database user for your cluster
5 Connect to your cluster
6 Load sample data or your own data!
